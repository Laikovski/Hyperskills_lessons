## Stage 1/4: Invite your friends 

    
    - Take user input â€” how many people want to join, including the user;
    - In case of an invalid number of people (zero or negative), "No one is joining for the party" is expected as an output;
    - Otherwise, take the friends' names as input, iteratively;
    - Store them in a dictionary initialized with zeros;
    - Print out the dictionary.
